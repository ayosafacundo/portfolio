Ships & Space Objects:

- No Man's Sky Venator Freighter

- Ariral Ship (the white triangle ship from Voices of the Void)

- Starbound ships to choose from:

- Halo's halo.

- Warframe 'Deimos' planet

- Manta ray from Black Mesa rework from Half Life 1 (or directly from HL1)


Hey would you be interested in a custom offer for a project of mine? I'm looking for a background in a 680x320 canvas (or something around that number, depending your opinion) that will be somewhat detailed and with a lot of objects. It'll be a drawing of space, with 1/4 of the space occupied with a planet, the center a big sun, my name on the top and a bunch of objects like Halo's ring or a capitol ship from No Man's Sky scattered around in the distance. I have my idea in a rough Aseprite canvas.
